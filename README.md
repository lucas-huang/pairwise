Pairwise Comparison
---------------------------

Pairwise comparison is a method of data collection often used in the scientific study of preferences, attitudes, and social choices.
A web application is the optimal way to make pairwise comparison accessible to surveyers and subjects alike, and using an open-source platform helps ensure transparency and encourages collaboration. 

* The R language and its Shiny library are used to develop the app. CSS is used for graphical enhancement. 
* The app is integrated with Google Sheets, where seed data and survey results are stored, using the googlesheets package. 
* The application is hosted on shinyapps.io (<https://pairwise.shinyapps.io/application/>)
